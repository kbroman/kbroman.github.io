title: "Draft Open Access Policy Implementation"
---

The
[University Library Committee](https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/university-library-committee/)
at the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)
has formed a working group to develop an Open Access Policy for
UW&ndash;Madison, through which university researchers would give
UW&ndash;Madison the right to freely distribute pre-prints of all
published journal articles.

The following is a draft of plans for implementing such a policy.

- upgrade software for [Minds@UW](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/)

- website for OA policy
  - frequently asked questions
  - web form for submission
  - web form for waiver

- outreach to faculty to request preprints
