Changes to RelCheck

24 August 2000: Version 0.67
------------------------------------------
Now checks that genotypes do not overrun
the given number of alleles per marker.


25 July 2000: Version 0.66
------------------------------------------
Fixed error in which family numbers were 
printed incorrectly when running against
all individuals (rather than just within
families)

Print results only when at least MINTYPED
markers were typed on a pair (see 
relcheck.h)

Slightly changed the header in the output 
file (though probably noone but me cares 
about this).




13 July 2000: Version 0.65
-----------------------------------------
NaN's could occur if recombination fractions
were allowed to be 0; so I added a lower 
threshold, MINR, taken to be 0.001.  
Recombination fractions < MINR are taken to
be MINR.




9 Feb 2000:  Version 0.6
-----------------------------------------
1. Input modified: 

   The "relcheck.gen" file should include 
   the total number of markers, and each 
   individual should have mom, dad and 
   sex listed

2. Output modified:
   
   The output is now to the file 
   "relcheck_out.csv" in comma-delimited
   form, suitable for use with MS Excel or
   StarOffice
