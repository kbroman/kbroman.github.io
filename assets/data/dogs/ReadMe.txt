The accompanying files consist of genotype data used to assemble the
first- (Mellersh et al, 1997) and second-generation (Neff et al, 1999)
linkage maps of the domestic dog.  All typings inconsistent with
Mendelian inheritance or causing tight multiple crossovers indicative
of genotyping errors have been removed from the data.

Some genotypes were gathered using autoradiographic methods, and so
are comprised of relative allele assignments.  Other data were
gathered by fluorescence-detection methods, and so are comprised of
absolute allele assignments.  Merging these data sets results in a
loss of the absolute allele information.  Therefore, we include 5
files to keep as much data intact as possible.  The files are as
follows: "berka.csv" and "berkx.csv" contain the absolute allele data
produced at UC Berkeley "auto.gen" and "xlinked.gen" contain relative
allele data for autosomal and xlinked marker genotypes for the
combined FHCRC/UC Berkeley data.  "IDInfo.csv" provides the
information necessary for linking these data sets.

Notes: 

    1. The Mignot family appears in auto.gen and xlinked.gen, but not
       in the other files, because this family was not typed at UC
       Berkeley.
    
    2. Individual 11 in CF-4 (code 64, name CF4-15) and individual 10
       in CF-8 (code 196, name CF8-24) do not appear in the auto.gen
       and xlinked.gen files, because they were determined to be
       probable MZ twins with other dogs in the data.
