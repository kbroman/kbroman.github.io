    We consider the problem of identifying the genetic loci (called
    quantitative trait loci (QTLs)) contributing to variation in a
    quantitative trait, with data on an experimental cross.  A large
    number of different statistical approaches to this problem have
    been described; most make use of multiple tests of hypotheses, and
    many consider models allowing only a single QTL.  We feel that the
    problem is best viewed as one of model selection.  We discuss the
    use of model selection ideas to identify QTLs in experimental
    crosses.  We focus on a back-cross experiment, with strictly
    additive QTLs, and concentrate on identifying QTLs, considering
    estimation of their effects and precise locations of secondary
    importance.  We present the results of a simulation study to
    compare the performance of the more prominent methods.
