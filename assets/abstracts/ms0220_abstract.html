<h4>Blades NJ, Broman KW (2002) Estimating the number of essential
genes in a genome by random transposon mutagenesis.  Technical Report
MS02-20, Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD</h4>

<table width=650>
<tr><td>
<p> We describe a Bayesian method for estimating the number of essential
genes in a genome, on the basis of data on viable mutants for which a
single transposon was inserted after a random TA site in a genome,
potentially disrupting a gene.  The prior distribution for the number
of essential genes was taken to be uniform.  A Gibbs sampler was used
to estimate the posterior distribution.  The method is illustrated
with simulated data.  Further simulations were used to study the
performance of the procedure.
