<tr><td>
<p> We introduce mixtures of binomial distributions derived by
assuming that the probability parameter p varies according to some
law.  We use the transformation p = exp(-t) and consider various
appropriate densities for the transformed variables.  In the process,
the Laplace transform becomes the fundamental entity.  Large numbers
of new binomial mixtures are generated in this way.  Some
transformations may involve several variates that lead to
"multivariate" binomial mixtures.  An extension of this to the
logarithmic distribution, with parameter p, is possible.  Frullani
integrals and Laplace transforms are encountered.

<tr><td>&nbsp;

<tr><td>
<p> Graphical representations of some of the more significant
distributions are given.  These include probability functions, regions
of validity, and three dimensional representations of probability
functions showing the response to variation of parameters when two
parameters are involved.
