<h4>Broman K, Speed T, Tigges M (1998) Estimation of
antigen-responsive T cell frequencies in PBMC from human
subjects. Statistical Science 13:4-8. </h4>

<p>	We describe a consulting project in which the statisticians
found that they needed to develop a new method of analysis in order to
reach valid conclusions about the effect of a herpes vaccine on the
immune systems of human subjects. This method estimates the frequency
of blood cells responding to a viral antigen at a single, carefully
chosen dilution.  The traditional analysis of such data uses a cut-off
to separate experimental sites ("wells") which contain no responding
cells from wells which contain at least one responding cell, whereas
our method uses the scintillation count to estimate the actual number
of responding cells for each well. We describe the experiment in some
detail, as we found that one of the major challenges facing the
statisticians was the need to understand the biology in enough detail
to provide a relevant model.
