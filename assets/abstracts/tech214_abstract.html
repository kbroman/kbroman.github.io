Technical report #214, Department of Biostatistics & Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison</h4>

<tr><td>
<p>  Genetic map construction remains an important
prerequisite for quantitative trait loci analysis in
organisms for which genomic sequence is not available.  Surprisingly
little has been written about the construction of genetic maps,
particularly regarding the many practical issues involved.  We provide
an overview of the process, including a description of the key
facilities in the R/qtl software.  The process is illustrated through
simulated data on an F<sub>2</sub> intercross derived from two inbred strains.
