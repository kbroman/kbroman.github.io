<p> Identifying the genetic loci contributing to variation in traits
which are quantitative in nature (such as the yield from an
agricultural crop or the number of abdominal bristles on a fruit fly)
is a problem of great importance to biologists. The number and effects
of such loci (called quantitative trait loci or QTLs) help us to
understand the biochemical basis of these traits, and of their
evolution in populations over time. Moreover, knowledge of these loci
can aid in designing selection experiments to improve the traits.

<p> There are a large number of different methods for identifying the
QTLs segregating in an experimental cross.  Little has been written
critically comparing the methods, and there have been few studies
comparing their performance; we make an attempt at this.
