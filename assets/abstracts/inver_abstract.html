<p>    In an analysis of human crossover interference, we identified
apparent triple recombination events, in a short region on chromosome
8p, on the maternally-derived chromosomes in four individuals (two
from each of two families).  While this may have indicated an error in
marker order, the inverted order was inconsistent with recombination
events in other individuals.  We were thus led to the hypothesis of an
inversion polymorphism in the region, which was subsequently confirmed
by fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH).  The inversion
spans approximately 7 cM on the female genetic map and 2.5 - 5.3 Mb
on the physical map.  The allele frequency of the inverted order
(D8S1130 telomeric; D8S351 centromeric) within 50 individuals of
European ancestry was 21%.  This is only the second known common, long
inversion polymorphism in the human genome.
